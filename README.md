# compiler-intermediate
One of the CS434 projects

## Description
Taking the compiler that we've been building and implement the intermediate code generation.


## Why Here
I'm going to start putting some of my schoolwork on github. Fellow Ags, please remember the honor code.

## TODO
Start with main recognition
Then begin with basic terminal processing.

|-----------------------------------|
Which nodes do I not need an Emit for in this AST?


|-----------------------------------|

- Add polymorphic Emit() function to Node
-
- "augment" the current CodeGenerator functions with array indexing, dynamic dispatch, etc.
